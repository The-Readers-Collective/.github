# Bookmarked 

## Overview
The Reader's Collective is a group of students from the Turing School of Software and Design who wanted an efficient and user-friendly way to share their libraries with other users. As the Capstone project for the seven-month intensive program, it was an opportunity for both programs to work together for the first time as a full-stack team.

## How / Under the hood

[TBA]

## If we had unlimited time:
Users would be able to:
- Follow fellow users and their libraries
- Message with fellow users to arrange for book swaps
- Search for books and users within a specified radius of their location
- Select which language they would like the view that app in
- Search for books additionally by language and subject matter / topic
